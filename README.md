# On the Acceleration of Time with Metric Expansion of the Universe

This private repository contains the original version of the paper authored by Viktor Iassinskii, PhD.

## Overview
This paper proposes that the flow of time accelerates proportionally to the expansion of the universe, in contrast to standard models that treat time as flowing uniformly. It draws on principles of General Relativity and cosmic scale expansion.

## Proof of Originality
